      <h1>How to count in binary (01010110) and read hexadecimal colours like <span class="digit" style="color:white;background:#CA5CAD;padding:0.2em">#CA5CAD</span></h1>

      <p>You probably haven't thought about how to count for a long time, but to learn a different counting system we'll have to go back to school and cover the basics.

      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Most people around the world use 10 digits for counting
         <span class="digit">0</span>
         <span class="digit">1</span>
         <span class="digit">2</span>
         <span class="digit">3</span>
         <span class="digit">4</span>
         <span class="digit">5</span>
         <span class="digit">6</span>
         <span class="digit">7</span>
         <span class="digit">8</span>
         <span class="digit">9</span>
         (after all, the word digit is another word for finger)
         but not everyone uses 10 digits. Some people use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigesimal">20 digits</a>... although I'm not sure if that means they learnt to count on their toes too.

      <p class="emoji-block">ðŸ™Œ</p>

      <p>Our 10 digit counting is called <b>Base 10</b> (or <b>Radix 10</b>).</p>

      <p><b>Base 2</b> is also known as Binary and it only has two digits <span class="digit">0</span> and <span class="digit">1</span>.

      <p><b>Base 16</b> is also known as Hexadecimal, and it uses the digits
         <span class="digit">0</span>
         <span class="digit">1</span>
         <span class="digit">2</span>
         <span class="digit">3</span>
         <span class="digit">4</span>
         <span class="digit">5</span>
         <span class="digit">6</span>
         <span class="digit">7</span>
         <span class="digit">8</span>
         <span class="digit">9</span>
         <span class="digit">A</span>
         <span class="digit">B</span>
         <span class="digit">C</span>
         <span class="digit">D</span>
         <span class="digit">E</span>
         <span class="digit">F</span>.

      <p>Ok let's get on with it...</p>

      <h2>The Principles of Counting</h2>

      <p>So let's think about when happens in <b>Base 10</b> when we've used all the digits available. We've counted from <span class="digit">0</span> to <span class="digit">9</span> and we've run out of digits so &mdash;of course&mdash; we add one to the next column, the tens column.

      <p>Try it out, <b>click Add or Subtract</b> to see how the 10s column is used:</p>

      <div data-base="10" data-number="1"></div>

      <p>Ah the good old days of primary school.</p>

      <p>The core principle to understand is that once you use all your digits you add one to the next column, and it's the same in Base 16:

      <div data-base="16" data-number="1"></div>

      <p>In Base 16 you go from <span class="digit">0</span> to <span class="digit">9</span> but then you haven't run out of digits, you've still got
        <span class="digit">A</span>
        <span class="digit">B</span>
        <span class="digit">C</span>
        <span class="digit">D</span>
        <span class="digit">E</span>
        <span class="digit">F</span>.
      So it's only when you get to <span class="digit">F</span> that you need to add 1 to the next column.

      <p>Play around with the hexidecimal counter until you feel comfortable with that idea, and before moving on to Base 2.

      <p>Base 2 looks like this:</p>

      <div data-base="2" data-number="1"></div>

      <p>With Base 2 (Binary) it's the same idea but you (almost immediately) run out of digits. You start with <span class="digit">0</span>, then <span class="digit">1</span>, then &mdash;because we've run out of digits&mdash; we add 1 to the next column making the number <span class="digit">10</span>.</p>

      <p>And that's how to count in different bases.</p>

      <h2>Base 16 (Hexadecimal) Colours</h2>

      <p>Computer colours are most commonly represented in <b>R</b>ed, <b>G</b>reen, <b>B</b>lue (RGB), each in numbers from <span class="digit">0</span> (none of that colour) to <span class="digit">255</span> (full amount of that colour).

      <p>But often these aren't written in Base 10 from <span class="digit">0</span> to <span class="digit">255</span>,
        they're written as three Base 16 (hexadecimal) numbers.</p>

      <p>The colour
        <span class="digit colour" style="color:white;background:#CA5CAD">#CA5CAD</span> is

        Red
        <span class="digit colour" style="color:white;background:#CA0000">CA</span> (the first two digits),

        Green
        <span class="digit colour" style="color:white;background:#005C00">5C</span> (the third and fourth digits),

        Blue
        <span class="digit colour" style="color:white;background:#0000AD">AD</span> (the last two digits).

        <div data-colour="#CA5CAD"></div>

        <p>Each colour always takes 2 digits, and if the value is only 1 digit long then it's prefixed with a 0.

        <p>The colour

                  <span class="digit colour" style="color:white;background:#06C49A">#06C49A</span> is

                  has a Red value of
                  <span class="digit colour" style="color:white;background:#060000">06</span> (very little red, about 2%),

                  Green
                  <span class="digit colour" style="color:white;background:#00C400">C4</span>,

                  Blue
                  <span class="digit colour" style="color:white;background:#009AAD">9A</span>.

      <div data-colour="#06C49A"></div>



      <h2>Finally...</h2>

      <p>When writing a number in Base 10 it's common to write a subscript 10 beside the number.
      <p>For example, 7 in Base 10 can be written as 7<sub>10</sub>
      <p>Writing 9 in Base 16 is 9<sub>16</sub> &nbsp; ...and so on.
      <p>This means that you will be able to tell the difference between <span class="digit">10<sub>2</sub></span> (the number 2 in Base 10), <span class="digit">10<sub>10</sub></span> (the number 10 in Base 10), and <span class="digit">10<sub>16</sub></span> (the number 16 in Base 16)
      <p>That's all for now. Cheers
